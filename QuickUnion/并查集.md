### 1.Problem

Quick Union is  a useful method to solve the dynamic connectivity problem, which can also be solved by depth-first search or breadth-first search. 	

### 2.Quick Union

* Data structure

  > Integer array id[]  of length N
  >
  > id[i] is the parent of i, and to find the root of i, you are supposed to keep going until the parent doesn't change.

* API

  | Connected(p,q) | To judge whether p and q have the same root. |
  | ------- | --------------------- |
  | Find(p)   | To find the root of p. |
  | Union(p,q) | Set the id of p's root to the id of q's root. |

* Code

  ```c++
  int find(int p){
      while(p!=id[p]){
          p = id[p];
      }
      return p;
  }
  
  bool connected(int p,int q){
      return find(p)==find(q);
  }
  
  void Union(int p,int q){
      int idp = find(p);
      int idq = find(q);
      if(connected(p,q)){
          return;
      }
      id[idp] = idq;
      count --;
  }
  ```

### 3.Improvements

#### 3.1 Weighting quick union 

* Idea

  > Balance by linking root of smaller tree to the root of lager tree
  >
  > ![捕获](C:\Users\hp\Desktop\捕获.PNG)

* Data structure 

  > Maintain extra array sz[] to count number of objects in the tree.

* Code

  ```c++
  void Union(int p,int q){
      int idp = find(p);
      int idq = find(q);
      if(connected(p,q)){
          return;
      }
      if(sz[idp]<sz[idq]){
          id[idp] = idq;
          sz[idq] += sz[idp];
      }else{
          id[idq] = idp;
          sz[idp] += sz[idq];
      }
      count --;
  }
  ```

* Summary
Through this improvement, run time can be reduced sharply from 2984ms to 52ms when the quick union is applied the 130th problem in the leetcode.

#### 3.2 Path compression

* Idea

  > When finding the node, just after computing the root of p, set the id[] of each examined node to point to that root.

* Code

  ```c++
  int find(int p){
      int temp = p;
      while(p!=id[p]){
          p = id[p];
      }
      id[temp] = p;
      return p;
  }
  ```
